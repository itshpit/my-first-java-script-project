# my-first-java-script-project
I completed 2 tasks during my java script classes. The first one reverses a number (e.g., so a number 123 will look like 321). The second one is a form. If you fill e-mail input with an e-mail which ends with a string "ua", you will receive an alert "Perhaps you are from Ukraine".")
