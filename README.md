# my-first-java-script-project
I completed 2 tasks during my java script classes. The first one reverses a number (e.g., so a number 123 will look like 321). The second one is a form. If you fill e-mail input with an e-mail which ends with a string "ua", you will receive an alert "Perhaps you are from Ukraine".")
Task 1
Create a function that reverse a number.
Task 2
Create the form with the text and submit input elements for Name, Surname, male or female, e-mail, phone of the user. Perform processing of the form for verifying the next. If two last letters of e-mail are “ua”, inform the user where he lives.
